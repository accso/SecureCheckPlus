        <BR>
        <B>4. Cookies</B>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The web application SecureCheckPlus by Accso uses cookies. Cookies
        are text files that are stored on a computer system via an internet browser.

        Many internet sites and web applications use cookies. Many cookies contain a cookie ID. A cookie ID is a
        unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters through which internet sites and
        web applications can be assigned to the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This
        allows visited internet sites and servers to distinguish the data subjectâ€™s browser from other internet
        browsers that contain different cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified
        using the unique cookie ID.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The application currently uses only technical cookies for session management or user
        recognition in the web application. The recognition makes the use of the web application
        easier. For example, the user does not have to re-enter their login details each time they visit the
        website or application because this is managed by the web application and the cookie stored on the user's
        computer system. Cookies are also used to ensure IT security, verifying executed requests, for example.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The data subject can, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our web application by means of
        a corresponding setting of the internet browser used, and thus may permanently deny the setting of
        cookies. Already set cookies can also be deleted at any time via an internet browser or other software
        programs. This is possible in all common internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting
        of cookies in the internet browser used, not all functions of our web application may be fully usable.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <B>5. Collection of General Data and Information</B>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The web application SecureCheckPlus by Accso collects a series of general data and
        information with each call-up by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information
        are stored in the server log files. The following may be collected: (1) the requested address (URL), (2)
        the referring website (referrer), (3) the date and time of access, (4) an IP address, and (5) other
        similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our IT systems.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        When using this general data and information, the application does not draw any
        conclusions about the data subject. This information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our web
        application correctly, (2) ensure the long-term viability of our IT systems and web application
        technology, and (3) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
        prosecution in the event of a cyberattack. Therefore, the operator of the application may statistically
        analyze this anonymously collected data and information with the aim of increasing data protection and
        data security in our company, to ultimately ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data
        we process.

        <B>6. Deletion Policy</B>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        As a principle, personal data should only be stored as long as necessary. If the legal basis for
        the collection of personal data no longer applies for the affected person, a short written notification to
        operator of the application is sufficient. See <A HREF="../contact">contact</A>.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        All data associated with the affected user will then be deleted (see chapter: Personal Data in Database).
        If the affected person is connected to data that cannot or should not be deleted, they will be anonymized.
        Free texts can reveal information that may lead back to the affected person. As a result,
        they cannot be automatically deleted.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        If the user wishes to anonymize these free texts, this request can also be communicated through
        the above-mentioned address.

        <I>f) Right to data portability</I>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Every data subject affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
        the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning them, which they have provided
        to a controller, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. They have the right
        to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the
        personal data has been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point
        (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract
        pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated
        means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
        the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Furthermore, in exercising their right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR,
        the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly
        from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so
        does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        To assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact
        the operator of the application.

        <BR>
        <I>g) Right to object</I>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Every data subject affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
        the European legislator, to object, on grounds relating to their particular situation, at any
        time, to processing of personal data concerning them, which is based on point (e) or (f) of
        Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The operator of the application shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection,
        unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
        rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        If operator of the application processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject
        shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning them for such marketing.
        This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
        If the data subject objects to operator of the application for direct marketing purposes,
        the operator of the application will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        In addition, the data subject has the right to object, on grounds relating to their particular situation,
        to processing of personal data concerning them which is carried out by the operator of the application
        for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to
        Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the
        performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        To exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact the operator of the application.
        Additionally, the data subject is free to exercise their right to object in the context of the use of
        information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC,
        by automated means using technical specifications.

        <I>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</I>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Every data subject affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
        the European legislator, to withdraw consent to the processing of their personal data at any time.
        If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw consent,
        they may at any time contact the operator of the application.

        <B>8. Legal basis for the processing</B>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The legal basis is Article 6 of the GDPR - Lawfulness of processing paragraph 1.
        A legitimate interest exists because a significant and appropriate relationship exists between the
        data subject and the operator of the application.
        The collection of personal data only takes place when using the web application. To use the web
        application correctly, the controller or the application of the application must be able to process
        personal data.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        The processing of personal data to the extent necessary for the prevention of fraud also constitutes
        a legitimate interest of the controller.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        <B>9. Duration for which personal data is stored</B>
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Personal data is only stored as long as it is in use.
        If the legal basis expires, such as through the right to deletion, the personal data will be deleted
        according to the deletion policy (see paragraph 6: Deletion Policy).
